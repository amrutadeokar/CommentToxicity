# 🛡️ Toxic Comment Detection System

A web-based application that detects toxic comments in real-time using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning. It prevents users from submitting toxic remarks by displaying a warning pop-up and blocking the message. When a user submits a non-toxic comment, a pop-up appears saying "Comment submitted successfully," and the comment is displayed under the respective post. If the comment is toxic, a pop-up appears saying "You cannot enter a toxic comment."
